The libraries required for these files to work are: 
    - matplotlib
    - numpy
    - scipy 
    - math
    - PIL 
    - cv2

To test each of the questions, the file must be run individually with python <filename>

        - python GaussianFilter.py

Files for Question 2 (median filter) and Question 8 (entropy) are not present
